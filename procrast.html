                Just a meandering, babbling, rambling post about not much at all really. <br> <br>
                A quick disclaimer before you commit to this, it meanders all over the shop, just like a procrastinator’s brain. Don’t say I didn’t warn you… <br> <br>
                I’ll admit at the top here, I didn’t used to think I was a procrastinator, not in any real sense. I don’t like sitting idle, unless it’s after dinner or I’m hungover (and when it comes to the latter it’s more a case of inability than lack of motivation) or it’s Christmas. There are a lot of caveats when I say I don’t like inaction, but I can justify all of them (I’m not going to, though just so you know). <br> <br>
                I’m even procrastinating while writing this (although I am quite impressed how quickly after thinking about writing about procrastinating I actually started to write about procrastinating, minutes, well less than 20, but after I had made myself a cup of tea and watched some Seth Meyers). It’s tough. This is something I am doing for me and which apart from seeing words appear on a screen doesn’t actually have a measurable end result – I don’t know if anyone will read this. I’m also writing this because I am procrastinating over job applications and a myriad of other things on my ‘to do’ list. And that is what I tend to procrastinate over, personal things, things that can be procrastinated over because there isn’t a deadline. Give me a deadline and I am all over it, will even try to finish before the deadline, so I have more time to not do things for me. <br> <br>
                So, to my special brand of procrastinating (although I am sure I am not unique in this), I do other things in order to not do certain things. For example, I find it extremely difficult to get down to any type of work if the house is a mess, or there are dishes that need doing (even just writing that has reminded me that there are tea strainers that need emptying and cleaning and now my head hurts a little bit), so I will clean up the visible mess and then once I’ve started I will always find something else to clean or sort. Living with my husband has exacerbated this slightly, you see, he is a hoarder who does not really see dirt, whereas I am not, either of those things. I’m not one of those procrastinators that falls down Wikipedia holes or go on a foray into YouTube, I like to be physically active in my procrastination.  <br> <br>
                I have a ‘to do’ list which I made on my first day of unemployment and 8 of those items were reminders of places in the house that need sorting. And that isn’t all of them, I have some mental notes of places that need sorting but not until after the places on the list are done. Does your head hurt yet, because mine is faintly throbbing.   <br> <br>
                Number one on the list, not physically but mentally - painting. I have, slowly, since the start of the year, been painting the rooms in our house. My husband ‘built’ it nearly 10 years ago and it is in need of a lick of paint. We started with the bathrooms (main and en-suite) and once you do one room (or in our case two) you realise how crappy the rest of the walls look and you’re off. When I told my husband my plan to paint the whole house, he said ‘I was afraid of that’, so I promised him that I wouldn’t need his help, that I am a strong modern woman and besides needing a bit of muscle every now and then to move furniture, I could do it on my own. Well, we are nine months into the year, and I am two bedrooms down (out of four) and two hallways down (out of two) and the house looks pretty much the same. Now I have a whole post planned on paint colours (contain your excitement for that one), so I won’t go into too much detail here, but what I will say is, when you paint walls just to spruce them up a bit and not drastically change the colour, it is a bit anti-climactic.  <br> <br>
                Sorry, my dog just woke from a nap and came in for a head scratch… where was I? <br> <br>
                Painting. Yes, so while there is no massive difference, the walls are basically the same colour and the cracks have been (mostly) filled, I can tick it off my ‘to do’ list and feel better that I haven’t wasted a day. Except… it gets to about 9pm and my brain is getting ready for sleep and bam! It starts going down the list of things yet to do and adding more things and then part of me wants to get started on them right away and another part wants to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow, and so I have stressful dreams and go to sleep wishing I hadn’t procrastinated all day.  <br> <br>
                This has kind of gotten away from me. I start writing about procrastinating and somehow end up not really writing about procrastinating. Maybe you can see where the name for this blog comes from – ‘The Road Anxiously Travelled’. <br> <br>
                You see the thing I am procrastinating over the most is the big question. What do you want to do with the rest of your life? I am not working; Covid-19 saw to that, and I’m actually fine with it. I’d had enough with what I was I doing, and we are in an enviable position (at least at the moment) where my husband has a decent job and I don’t need to be too active in the job-hunting arena. But… while I know that we can survive for a while without my salary, I also don’t want to be beholden to anyone and I want to contribute, but … I also can’t face doing a job that doesn’t bring me any joy (Marie Kondo has a lot to answer for – I held up all the job adverts, looked at them and no, they did not bring me joy, so they had to go). I had a look yesterday and felt worse for it.  <br> <br>
                So that’s it, I suppose. Strange what actually came out when I started writing. I thought I would tell you that I clean and bake to procrastinate and that while I don’t like sitting idle I watch an awful lot of Netflix and the like while thinking about what to do next, or while cleaning and baking, which I half did. I was going to tell you that I procrastinate by walking through the house and mentally listing all that needs doing, which I guess I did, sort of. I was going to tell you that I will periodically interrupt my dog’s naps (don’t feel bad for him, his whole life is a nap) to tell him I love him and give him belly rubs and head scratches and that it helps me think. But I didn’t, so there you go…maybe next time.   <br> <br>
