                <p>I'm a Brit living in Perth, Australia and finding it a bit tough at the moment, truth be told. 
                <br> Under-employed, far from 'home', and family, and friends. <br>
                But, I'm learning to code and this is my experimental blog project
                </p>

                <h3>Snails</h3>
                <p>A strange topic for my first blog post but the work and adventures of these slippery devils has been a curiosity for me in the last few months. 
                    Here goes, but first a little preamble. <br> Every morning, early, before dawn, I walk the dog (or more accurately am walked by the dog), it is dark and the light on his collar does not cast a wide or bright beam. Every so often, in my half-awake daze I will, too late, see a small dark mass on the pavement ahead and before my brain can register what it is, I have heard the crunch which is unmistakably snail, and not woodchip or some other inanimate object. Now, I am a vegetarian and lover of most creatures and will try my darndest not to step on, hoover up or otherwise kill even a fly (except cockroaches, they can all go to hell, and I have been known to panickingly empty half a can of Mortein on those devil insects), and that crunch sends shivers up my leg and a wave of guilt washes over me. It is only mild guilt and it passes quickly, but it is guilt all the same.
