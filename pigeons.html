                    For the last four days we have had a pigeon problem. It all started the week before Christmas when we were awoken by a rather large branch falling off the tree in the park opposite our house. I jumped up and put trainers on (and to Ben’s amusement, not covering my extremely stylish and Christmassy ‘What the Elf’ pyjamas) so I could help to drag as much as possible off the road. The neighbours next door came to help, and within 10 minutes we had dragged most of the bulk off the road. <br> <br>
                    It took the council two attempts to cut and mulch the debris – apparently my description of a ‘really big branch that was half covering the road when it fell’ wasn’t good enough. Still, there are four large logs left, hollow in the middle, awaiting I’m not sure what in the park where they fell. Logs which we think were home to some pigeons… <br> <br>
                    Ben and I came home Sunday afternoon (I’m writing this on Wednesday) to an excitable dog who keep worrying the blinds in our bedroom and whining. This is not unusual Chico behaviour, but it was persistent, so we decided to see if he could actually see something, or whether he only thought he could. Turns out, there were two small pigeons – not exactly babies, but not adults either, slightly dishevelled, and hiding from the neighbour cats and Chico behind a plant pot outside our front door.  <br> <br>
                    We let them be for a while, but when it became clear that they weren’t going anywhere and night was falling, we made a make-shift bed for them and put them in the garage. Day came and we decided to relocate them to the logs, with some sticks across the opening to protect them, somewhat, from the cats. A few hours later and they were back, maybe they knew we were having a barbeque or thought they would rather take their chances with an overenthusiastic dog than the prowling cats, but as our friends arrived, the birds did too.  <br> <br>
                    <img class="other-image" src="resources/images/chico door.jpg">
                    Again, we let them be, until nightfall and back into the box in the garage they went. Another relocation in the morning, sticks readjusted, and cats shooed away. Until… finally, a present I’d ordered well ahead of Christmas (it was now the 29th) arrived with a courier who informed me – “you’ve got a little bird down here”. Oh for crying out loud! One of them, obviously the more adventurous or less injured of the two had made the journey back across the road, and then later, alerted to their presence by Chico, I saw that both had returned. Yet another relocation, same place, this time hoping that they had got the message, feeling only a little bit silly as I softly but forcible encouraged them to stay put.  <br> <br>
                    Success! Maybe they were disorientated or realised that it was marginally closer to their log, but hours later they found their way to our next-door neighbour’s garage, where they stayed the night, – a small victory, they were no longer our problem. But of course, that’s not the end of it. I had spent a good half an hour the previous day ringing first the council rangers and then various other organisations they had given me numbers for (as the rangers don’t deal with birds, and other organisations don’t bother with pigeons), and declared that if the pigeons returned I would relocate them to the other side of the main road – down a hill, across 4 lanes and up a hill, and see if they could get back from there.  <br> <br>
                    No sign of the pigeons this morning as I ventured out to the beach with Chico and no sign of them when we got back, nothing until I was having breakfast and heard the tell-tale sound of blinds being disturbed and a dog discovering that the pigeons had returned. That was it, gloves on, box out and in they went, making sure the dog was watching and would not spend the day wondering if they were still there. I carefully relocated them to a lovely park in a shaded area, a cursory glance assured me that there were no cats waiting to snatch them up for elevenses and honestly, if I were a pigeon I’d be happy to find myself in such a lovely new home. <br>
                 
                        
                    
                
                    What have I learnt from this? (1) If you find possibly injured pigeons on your front step, don’t call the rangers – they don’t care. (2) Don’t give said pigeons a nice warm place to sleep for the night – they will never leave you alone. (3) Relocate those birds as far away as you can the first time – they will not accept a short-distanced relocation the first time and will come back for more. (4) Last, but not least, if you have a dog who is fascinated by the pigeons, make sure that he sees you relocating them otherwise he will not believe you and will require hard evidence that they have left the building.  <br> <br>
