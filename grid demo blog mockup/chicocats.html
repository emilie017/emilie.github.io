                My dog Chico has an obsession with cats. Up until recently we weren’t sure whether it was the type of obsession he has with birds – in that he wants to catch and eat them (innate breeding taking over), or whether he just wanted to play. It has become clear in the last few days that his obsession is, thankfully, of the friendly, playful kind and not the catch and kill kind. 
                <br>
                Chico has a spot in our bedroom window that overlooks the street, where he sits for hours at a time. He, like his mother (and like her nana), is a curious chap and likes to know what is going on in the street. It also means he is perfectly placed should a cat go sauntering by. When this happens, he freezes, then leaps into action, excitedly racing from the bedroom to the back garden to look through the tiny crack in the gate. This can happen at all times of the day and night, and while it was a bit strange and disconcerting the first time it happened, it so common place now, it barely registers
                <br><br>
                When I say all times of the day and night, I literally mean that. The other morning Ben had woken up before his alarm at about 4.30 and there was Chico, having a staring contest with a cat. No idea how long they had been like that, or how much longer it went on, it was 4.30 – I woke up, looked, appreciated the strangeness of the moment, and went back to sleep.

                When we see cats on our walks, Chico straightens up and pulls like crazy on his lead, desperate to be closer. And then he starts to look a bit intimidating, hence why we were unsure as to his intentions re: cats. Mostly he stands very still and stares at the cat- tail wagging but the rest of the body stiff as a board. Evidently this is not endearing or comforting for the cat experiencing this level of attention. We drag him away, but he always has a little pep in his step after a cat encounter. 
                <br><br>
                He doesn’t always notice cats sitting in front windows. Whether he is focused on the hedge ahead that once held a cat and so must always be a potential cat hiding place or whether he just isn’t that bright (my husband would bet on the latter), as obsessed as he is, he doesn’t see them all. He flat out ignored a hairless sphinx cat the other morning, but that seems fair, it definitely didn’t look like a cat. And then there are all the things that he thinks are cats, but aren’t – that’s a whole other post. 
                <br><br>
                For a while, there was a kitten living next door. There is a gap under the fence between our houses and Chico would lean down in order to look for the cat. A few times when putting out the washing I saw this little paw come shooting out under the fence and Chico would get excited; they would play between the fence with what little space they had. Once, the kitten escaped, unbeknownst to us he made it into our back garden. It wasn’t until there was an unusual noise that I went to investigate and found Chico staring at a bush, one that contained the aforementioned kitten. That evening while we waited for our neighbour to come home from work and collect the cat, Chico was beside himself, like he couldn’t believe his luck. <em>There was an actual cat inside his house!</em> We put the cat in the laundry, shut the door, and Chico spent the evening either outside the laundry door in the house, or outside looking in through the glass sliding door. The poor cat must have felt a little unsettled to be stared at relentlessly for 2 hours. Even though they moved out over 6 months ago, I still catch Chico looking under the fence for his pal.          
                <br><br>
                Fast forward to this past week and there’s a new kitten on the block, well, not our block but we walk past its house most days on our way from the dog park. Max - a black and white kitten, and bold as brass. First time we saw him, he came running over, Chico froze, as he is wont to do, and Max booped him on the snoot, twice. Chico was enthralled. We have seen this kitten several times now, Chico knows where to look out for him, and every time Max sees Chico he strides over, ready for another play.
                <br><br>
                Since we’ve had Chico there has been another cat in his life – Jasper. Jasper is my sister in law’s cat and so we see him regularly. Chico perks up in the car when he knows we are nearby. As I said, up until recently we weren’t sure of Chico’s cat related intentions, and as Jasper has had bad interactions with other dogs, he is always on edge and hisses when he sees Chico, so we try our best to keep them apart. Chico has, on a few occasions, had Jasper cornered in the garden doing his weird intense starey thing, which has obviously done nothing to quell Jasper’s dog related fears.   
                <br><br>
                Well, last weekend we had a breakthrough. Chico was outside looking in through the glass sliding doors and I was holding Jasper, stroking him and trying to reassure him that he was safe. Chico let out a noise we had not heard before – a high pitched excited squeal and went into full playful puppy pose; he doesn’t even do that with other dogs. Jasper was not impressed, quivering in my arms, and hissing in Chico’s direction. For me, it was confirmation that all Chico wants to do with cats is play, even if he terrifies them with his excitement.
                <br><br>
                We saw Max again yesterday after Chico had spent 20 minutes ignoring the other dogs in the dog park, Chico was thrilled to be walking home. Max did not disappoint; he leapt off the bins and came racing towards us. Chico, after finally being able to sniff Max’s butt, again went into full playful mode. 
                <br><br>
                All that’s to say, my dog is obsessed with cats, in a good way, but not in a way that puts them at ease. I’m convinced he must have lived with a cat in his first home. If we could just find a bigger cat, one that’s not intimidated by a big doofus, he could have a play mate. But not in our house, unlike my dog, I’m not really a cat person.
