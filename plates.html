                 <p>
                    There is an abundance of personalised number plates (or twat plates as I like to call them) in Western Australia; you see them by the carload.  <br> <br>
                    I don’t know whether there just aren’t as many in New South Wales, or whether because I was mainly taking buses when I lived in Sydney it meant that I didn’t see them, but they are everywhere in Perth and since I moved here in 2017 I’ve been taking note of some of the more ‘interesting’ ones. <br> <br>
                    I don’t have a problem with personalised plates that are advertising a business, that makes sense, kind of. What I do have a problem with are the sheer number of ‘twat’ plates on privately owned cars. I’ll admit it does make it easier to know which cars/drivers to avoid on the road. I’ve decided, after a lot of thought and discussion with others that those who have ‘twat’ plates are the kind of people who tailgate you, the kind of people who undertake you, the kind of people who take up more than one car parking space, the kind of people who leave their shopping trolley in the parking bay, the kind of people who have gender reveal parties, the kind of people who blare music from their phones in public places… am I wrong? <br> <br>
                    I’ll give you some examples so you can see what I mean (unfortunately, I don’t have any photographic evidence of any of these as I mainly see them when I’m driving, and as such cannot take a photo): <br> <br>
                    - SNOOKUMS (pink plate with white writing). This was on a burgundy car, so not only is it truly terrible, but there was also some offensive colour clashing going on too. <br> <br>
                    - CU 1M OFF. <br> <br>
                    - 4ME2NO. I think this one gave me a stomach-ache. <br> <br>
                    - I GOTTA P.  Arguably this would be mine due to my miniscule bladder, but why anyone would want to advertise that is beyond me. <br> <br>
                    - MTHMSTER. Ben saw this one and is hoping that the first missing vowel is an ‘A’ and not an ‘E’, but we are in Perth so who knows. <br> <br>
                    (We’ve also come to the conclusion that vowels must be more expensive as there are so many plates where a number is substituted for a letter or the vowel is omitted altogether.) <br> <br>
                    -LACKNMONY. Maybe you wouldn’t be LACKNMONY if you hadn’t wasted it on a twat plate.  <br> <br>
                    Those six are just the tip of the iceberg, I have seen thousands and have at least 50 in the ‘notes’ app on my phone. There are plates that look like someone’s password, plates that just have the person’s name and their year of birth or age, plates that make no logical sense and some that just tell you what car they are on (LILYSMAZDA)… <br> <br>
                    Putting aside the fact that they look extremely tacky, which for most sane people would be a reason to stay clear, they are also fairly pricey. I had a quick look on the website and the cheapest plates I could see started at $200; I’m going to assume that is for the pair. From the quick look I had on the website and from my observations of ‘twat’ plates in the wild, I’m guessing that the average person spends at least $400 on theirs. What a massive waste of money! <br> <br>
                    You might think I am being incredibly judgemental and unfair about ‘twat’ plate owners. But we’re all judging each other every day. You see someone in a MAGA hat, you’re going to have some idea of what that type of person is like. Someone who knocks on your door in the middle of the day wearing a suit, you have an idea of what they are going to ask you. You see a person in a car with a personalised number plate and you know that they are not going to stop at the zebra crossing. It’s just nice to be forewarned. <br> <br>
