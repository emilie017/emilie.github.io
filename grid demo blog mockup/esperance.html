                    Staying at an Air B ’n’ B which was off the grid, with chickens, and who made their own honey, meant that we had fresh eggs for breakfast and tasters of delicious honey when we checked in. It was a Sunday and we had decided to take it easy – a wander around the market which had a variety of stalls selling homemade crafts and treats, and then a drive to see what all the beautiful beaches had to offer. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our host had given us a map the day before with all the beaches that we should visit circled. There’s a tourist drive that takes you out to the furthest one (on the tourist map) and then swings back towards Esperance with the opportunity to stop at as many beaches that take your fancy. We stopped at most of them, they were all beautiful – white sand, blue water… windy. There weren’t many folks out on the water, and you certainly wouldn’t get me out there – far too sharky. 
                    <br><br>
                    Ben and I love a good brewhouse and Esperance has one called Lucky Bay – it’s emblem is a kangaroo (after the kangaroos that live in and around that particular beach) and we had tried one of their beers the night before, and it was tasty. Sundays are also great days for sitting in beer gardens, sun beating down, wind blowing your card game off the table while you enjoy a cold brew and a hot pizza. The brewery had opened later than usual that day as it was hosting a memorial service for a surfer who had been the victim of a shark attack – as far as I’m aware, they hadn’t actually found him, just a surfboard that had clearly been nibbled by a shark, and two bits of a wetsuit, like I said – Esperance is sharky. 
                    <br><br>
                    Monday dawned, and one of the main reasons we had gone to Esperance - Cape Le Grand National Park. If you google pictures of Esperance pictures of Cape Le Grand are the majority of what you will see. It’s about a 45 minute drive from Esperance town, mostly through flat farmland with no hint of what lies beyond. The beaches there are next level beautiful. I don’t think I have ever seen sand that white. Before the beaches though, came the hike – Frenchman Peak. 
                    <br><br>
                    Frenchman Peak is a class 5 hike up a granite slab that kind of looks like a hat, a Frenchman’s hat, hence the name. Really not advisable if the weather were anything other than sunny - the slightest hint of moisture and the whole peak would be as slippery as an ice rink. It was super windy, which was both good and bad – good because it kept it from feeling quite so warm, but bad because it really didn’t seem like it would be fun coming down, and maybe also a bit dangerous. The hike is more like a scramble, you have to use your hands for a lot of the way up (and down), following the little metal markers that show the advised route.
                    <br><br>
                    It wasn’t easy going and people coming down were making me anxious as it looked to be worse on the descent and they weren’t alleviating my fears. We got to the ‘peak’ where there is gap through which you can see the ground below and out to the coast. Spectacular views, all around. But, the sitting was making me more nervous, I was anxious about going down, I’m not sure why, and as I was quietly trying to quell my panic attack Ben climbed up further and out of sight. It was only when I heard a yell that I realised he wasn’t near me and the horrified thought that he had somehow fallen off rose up quickly, swiftly followed by the relief that he was calling me and waving from above. 
                    <br><br>
                    Anyway, I collected myself, shut the demons away for a bit and we headed down, slowly. It actually wasn’t that bad going down, a lot easier than I had built up in my head. We were passed by a family going up - mum, two young kids, and a barefoot dad… If they could do it, we could too.

                    After Frenchman Peak, we headed further into the park and to Lucky Bay. Most of the pictures of Lucky Bay show kangaroos on the beach, and I was looking forward to some native fauna chilling with the tourists, but no such luck. Not a kangaroo in sight! Typical! A truly beautiful beach all the same. The sand was so compact that we could drive onto it, and the water was so blue and inviting I would have loved to have a swim, but I am a massive wuss when it comes to swimming in the ocean; I don’t like being cold and that water was on the chilly side. I had a paddle and Ben had a swim and it was a wretch to leave, but there were more beaches to see. 
                    <br><br>
                    
                    There was not a single disappointing beach that day, in fact, they seemed to get better. We saved the best for last – Wharton Beach. We had been told by our accommodation host that the beaches near the town were ‘good’, the beaches in Cape Le Grande (Lucky Bay etc) were ‘better’, but that Wharton beach at the edge of the national park and a bumpy drive down an unsealed road, was ‘the best’ She was right. Wharton Beach is breathtaking. It is a wide expanse of a sweeping bay with white sand and blue sea. Apart from a car 100 metres to our left and another far off to the right, we had the place to ourselves. It would have been a great place to spend an afternoon – with a picnic, a few beers, some games, and (even though dogs are not allowed in the national park) Chico would have loved it. But we were out of nibbles and were in need of something more refreshing than water, so after a couple of cartwheels on the beach and a short respite, we made our way back to town.
