                    Pretty much just a long rave (the first of what I’m sure will be many) about how much I love my dog. 
                    <br><br>
                    Chico, or Chimko, or Chicoco, or Sweet Pea, or Buddy, or (quite frequently) Jerko, all, or none, or a combination; he’ll answer to anything if you’ve got food in your hand and he’ll answer to nothing if there is a bird or a cat in his sights. 
                    <br><br>
                    I’d wanted a dog for as long as I can remember but was never allowed one. I kind of see why, they are a lot of responsibility and we used to go away for 2-3 weeks every summer and couldn’t exactly take the dog with us to Europe. I had rabbits and guinea pigs and hamsters and would satisfy my dog craving by, every so often, being walked by the next-door neighbour’s Border Collie. Most Friday nights, my dad would raise my hopes because when asked where he was off to would reply – “I’m going to see a man about a dog”. Now, in my naïve seven year old brain, I really did think that my dreams had come true and my dad was leaving the house at 8pm on a Friday night to discuss purchasing me a dog. I’d like to say that I have become less trusting and easily fooled as I’ve grown up, but I am not sure that’s entirely true. 
                    <br><br>
                    So, I never did get a dog and it wasn’t until years later that my parents found out that I had genuinely thought my dad was going off in search of a dog every Friday night and just never seemed to find the right one. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, my husband (Ben) is a dog lover, I’m not sure it would have worked out between us if I was and he wasn’t or vice-versa, and we had been talking about getting a dog for over a year before we actually found Chico. We even visited a dog shelter a couple of times and, for fun, I would occasionally scroll through local adoption websites to see if there were any doggos who would suit. Well, in December 2018, by chance, we got wind of a dog who had escaped and was sitting in the pound of a council on the other side of the city. We were told he was an escape artist, who had escaped for the last time, it seemed, as when they tried to find his previous owners… they had moved. If you ever meet Chico, you will not be able to understand how anyone could just abandon such a sweet dog, but he’s an active breed (German Shorthaired Pointer, since you were wondering) and some people don’t realise what they’ve got themselves into. 
                    <br><br>
                    That said, the fact that it wasn’t his first stint in the pound should’ve raised some red flags, then what happened when Ben went to get him should have set the alarm bells ringing. Of course, the fact that I’m telling you he is my dog now, tells you that we are not as smart as we seem (and we can seem very smart when we try). Ben, drove to the other side of town, gets let into the council pound, explains who he is there to collect, and as he is doing the paper work, Chico, the escape artist, sees this as his chance; he had been in those council kennels for nearly 2 weeks, his owners had gone, he was going to make a break for it. Ben described to me how Chico just took off running, this was a big council yard, and the council workers took after him on foot and in carts to chase him down. Ben was tempted to just leave, this was clearly a sign, Chico had been abandoned for a reason and now he was giving us an ‘out’. Instead, Ben crouched down, unsure if this would solve anything and sure enough, up trots Chico, and he is ours. 
                    <br><br>
                    I would like to think that this is all a sign, Chico chose Ben. In reality and from experience we know the following to be true: Chico will not go up to you if you are chasing him, on the other hand ,if you are a bystander,  or minding your own business, or happen to have a fist full of dog treats… 
                    <br><br>

                    It’s strange how adaptable we are as humans, one day we didn’t have a dog and the next there was a furry four-legged ‘child’ demanding our attention and food and we just got on with it. I know having a dog is not the same as having children (although at least you can take kids to national parks and the majority of pubs in Australia, dogs not so much) but I definitely didn’t think I would end up loving this furry doofus as much as I do, so in that way they are similar; he’s part of the family and a regular prince. 
                    <br><br>
                    I could fill pages with Chico stories, and I will, just not today. This is only the origin story, there is so much more to come…

                    My dog Chico has an obsession with cats. Up until recently we weren’t sure whether it was the type of obsession he has with birds – in that he wants to catch and eat them (innate breeding taking over), or whether he just wanted to play. It has become clear in the last few days that his obsession is, thankfully, of the friendly, playful kind and not the catch and kill kind.
