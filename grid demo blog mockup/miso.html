                Definition: Hatred of Sound. Misophonia is a disorder where people have abnormally strong and negative reactions to the ordinary sounds humans make, such as chewing or breathing. It is not unusual for people to occasionally be irritated by some everyday sounds. But for individuals with misophonia, the sound of someone smacking their lips or clicking a pen can make them want to scream or hit out. These physical and emotional reactions to innocent, everyday sounds are similar to the “fight or flight” response and can lead to feelings of anxiety, panic, and rage.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought I’d start out with a definition (thank you <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320682" target="_blank">medicalnewstoday.com</a>), as I’m not sure many people have heard of Misophonia even if they are a sufferer, like me. To be honest, I didn’t know there was a name for it until recently (shout-out to ‘Armchair Expert podcast’ with Dax Shepherd which first made me aware of this term), even though I have experienced this insensitivity to certain sounds for as long as I can remember and knew that it wasn’t just me being, as my dad said, ‘intolerant’. 
                <br> <br> There are many sceptics out there (Dax and his co-host and fact checker Monica among them), but I am here to tell you it is real and can be hellish. The picture above (just a google search of fork and teeth and then cropped, not me – no… just no), gives me goose-bumps and sets my teeth on edge. In fact, just thinking about someone using their teeth to scrape food off their fork, leaves me cold. I know people who do this regularly and having dinners with them can be super stressful. I have even, on occasion, asked them mildly if it hurts their teeth, hoping they would get the hint and stop, but it seems these serial offenders are often unaware that they are doing it. <br> <br>
                I went to the dentist this week, I hadn’t been in 2 years and had been avoiding it for a number of reasons: cost, potential pain, but most importantly – the metal scraping on my teeth. Wow, this is super stressful to write, so glad I have had coffee, but might be in need of something stronger once I’ve finished. I think my dentist thinks I am scared of ‘The Dentist’, and that the scraping of my teeth with his nightmarish metal torture devices is painful. Ah, I wish it were so. I was lying there clenching my fists and trying not to look too distressed and wondering if he had plastic scrapers he could use, or if next time I could take ear plugs and my noise-cancelling headphones and explain the problem to him. Clearly, no one who works in a dentist surgery has misophonia because they would go insane and quit on the first day.   <br> <br>
                So, while an apple a day keeps the doctor away, it can also get rid of misophonia sufferers pretty quickly too. Apples. The worst fruit…or at least for me, audibly speaking (I actually eat them a lot, strange that my eating them doesn’t have an effect). People who eat apples on public transport should be ashamed of themselves. I don’t eat noisy food on public transport out of consideration for fellow sufferers who might be nearby. But apples are the worst. In the past, I have left a room when a colleague starts eating an apple (discreetly, not just up and left in disgust - I have some social skills), or similarly crunchy fruit (like an unripe pear or nectarine), or cracker biscuits. This is not as easy if you are on a bus or a train and someone sits next to you, pulls out an apple and proceeds to chomp down without a care in the world. I visualise snatching the offending fruit out of their hands and launching it down the train, while onlookers cheer and thank me for saving their ears and their sanity. Even worse are those evil fruit-devourers who, when they get near the core do not stop eating, sated, but continue to take small quick nibbles of the remaining apple until I am at my wits end. <br> <br>
                I read a bit about misophonia before writing this and the majority of the time, the most offensive noises are ones associated with the mouth, so eating, and metal on teeth. I listen to a lot of podcasts, and I tell you there are a lot of podcasters out there who find it totally reasonable to eat or drink into a microphone whilst recording a podcast; that’s a good way to lose listeners. I have been tempted to email the offenders and inform them of their crime, alas, I am not one of those people. I do not write comments on Facebook posts, or rage email podcasters. No, instead I craft a perfectly argued and reasoned email in my head, do not send it, and then write a blog post.  <br> <br>
                I also didn’t fully comprehend until recently that I react differently depending on my mood that day or state of mind (thank you Sarah Silverman, comedian and guest on the aforementioned Armchair Expert podcast, and fellow sufferer). On days when I am more stressed or feeling more anxious, my reaction to an apple muncher or biscuit cruncher is more heightened. My recent trip to the dentist, which I had been nervously anticipating since I’d booked it, was perhaps more stressful than usual.  <br> <br>
                Now, there are many situations out in the world that cause noise induced misophonic reactions, some are outlined above, but there are more, some of which I am sure I have blocked out right now due to their distressing nature. There are ways in which I navigate the world trying to avoid situations and people who will induce my misophonia: noise-cancelling headphones for the win on public transport – blocking out anyone who dares to sit next to me and munch away, and serving food that doesn’t require cutlery or suggesting restaurants where cutlery will not be required for eating (pizza places or burger joints) with friends who are serial fork on teeth scrapers. <br> <br>
                Of course, it is not always possible to avoid such sounds and so this is my plea to all you non-misophonia sufferers out there. Stop using your teeth to scrape food off you fork, do not, under any circumstances eat apples on public transport, and to all you podcasters, please, I’m begging you, eat and drink before you record, we (‘misophonians’) will all be eternally grateful.  <br> <br>
