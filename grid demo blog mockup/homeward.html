                    This had been a holiday of firsts – Wave Rock, Esperance and Cape Le Grand, and we had one more to go – the Porongorups. Extremely satisfying to say, beautiful to see. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Porongorups are about 4 and a half hours north-west of Esperance so we had another long day in the car ahead of us. On our first day when we left Perth we had started ‘waving’ to other cars on the road (what Bill Bryson would call the ‘Malhamdale wave’ – your index finger slowly raised from the steering wheel in a sort of salute), there is a section of the road called the <em>Wave Highway</em> encouraging folks to acknowledge other travellers and, on that stretch of road at least, most returned the ‘wave’. Well, we carried it on for the whole trip, our return wave success rate (or RWSR) wasn’t great – people who were clearly local to the area never waved back, you might get a wave from a truck or trade van, but the highest RWSR was from the caravans and other travellers, still, never more than 2 or three in a row. 
                    <br><br>
                    We were booked into a campsite in the Stirling ranges, which is a mountain range with the highest peaks in south WA, but getting to the Porongorups meant driving past the campsite, and up the road another 30 minutes. Still, it was worth it. The Porongorups are much favoured by those searching for the perfect Instagram shot, understandably so – it is a beautiful spot, annoyingly so when you are stuck behind those taking a thousand photos. The main walk is up to Castle Rock a rocky outcrop which has a raised metal walkway and lookout. The walk wasn’t too steep and was perfectly shaded with some wild flowers dotted in between the trees. 
                    <br><br>
                    There were plenty of little rustlings and small tails disappearing into the undergrowth, and then, a snake slithering across the path, paying us no attention at all. I hadn’t seen it and was about a foot away from it when Ben pulled me back, thankfully he’s more observant. We stood and watched it make its way to safety while the guy of a couple we had overtaken earlier caught us up and decided it was probably a Western Brown snake (it wasn’t). 
                    <br><br>
                    We woke up quite dusty the next day – the drinks had gone down far too easily the night before; first sitting around a campfire drinking beer and chatting with other campers, and then sitting on our own drinking rum and coke until we decided to call it a night. Thankfully, we hadn’t planned on getting up before dawn to walk up Bluff Knoll (highest peak in South WA), but instead were planning on an ‘easier’ hike up Mount Trio. It wasn’t easy, less than 10 minutes in, we both wondered aloud whether it was such a good idea, and would we even make it – the legs were heavy, the head too, and the constant buzzing of flies didn’t help. 
                    <br><br>
                    Mount Trio had been devastated by a bush fire the year before. There were signs of life coming back, but most of the mountain side was a bleak fire scarred landscape. Relieved and a little amazed to have made it to the top we were rewarded with amazing panoramic views of the whole area, there was what looked to be an eagle swooping around, but we didn’t have much time to enjoy the peak when we were besieged by feral bees and forced to beat a hasty retreat.

                    We were staying the night in Albany, about an hour down the road, in what was the cheapest place we could find and what might have been the worst bed ever – too short, barely a double, a bit saggy in the middle, and flat pillows, we both woke up quite broken and feeling a lot older. The nearly 5-hour car journey home would tip us both over the edge and require massages in the coming days. 
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the final 24 hours, it was a good trip, too short as they always are and although we were travel (and bed) sore, we were loath to get back to ‘normal’ life. The car was covered in a patchwork of all the bugs that we had driven through, even after a thorough wash there were remnants of dead butterflies in the grills. A similar fate for the swag which was besieged by earwigs and beetles when we took it down on our final night camping – half a can of bug spray and a shake got most of them – the rest were left to suffocate until we could apply non-hungover focus to the removal of said bugs. 
                    <br><br>
                    I’d definitely go back – to see the wild flowers or to spend a longer time at some of those beautiful beaches… but, no hurry, there’s so much of Western Australia still to see.
