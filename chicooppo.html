    I’ve written before about how Chico is a bit of an escape artist, it’s basically how he came to live with us, and almost how he came to not live with us. But what I think Chico is at heart, at his core, is an opportunist. 
    <br><br>
    So many of his ‘quirks’ that can be attributed to him being a big dumb jerk of a dog, or an ‘independent’ dog are also results of opportunities that he has seized. He is a dog who will drink out of the toilet because the lid is up and it is nearer than his bowl, which is on the other side of the (small-ish, one level) house and filled with fresh, (often) chilled, filtered water. He is a dog who will eat fruit out of the fruit bowl because he had the opportunity to fetch it out and there was no one home to stop him. He is a dog who will go running around the neighbourhood because someone left a door open, and he saw his opportunity. 
    <br><br>
    The last of those examples is, I think, the height of Chico’s opportunistic streak. He doesn’t escape through open doors or gates because of some malicious intent (he’s a dog) or because he doesn’t get enough exercise. No, he merely noticed an opening and took the opportunity to have an adventure. 
    <br><br>
    Since the first week we had him, he has been running off from us. His recall is terrible; we haven’t done enough to train him, but also his drive to run and explore supersedes any shouts or imploring to return. He has run around our neighbourhood on countless occasions, once when we had the plumber round - Chico had been seemingly fast asleep on the couch, until the front swung open and he was off. Whether he had been waiting for the door to open enough for him to get out, or whether his eyes had opened at the exact moment the door did, we’ll never know, but off he went and had a great time. 
    <br><br>
    So far, he has been very lucky not to get hit by a car. He dashes across 70km limit roads with no heed of cars or buses. This is a dog whom I have driven next to at 20km (possibly slower, I wasn’t paying attention to the speed) as he ran down a suburban street, ears flapping in the breeze and a look of total bliss on his big dumb jerk face, my goodness he’s lucky he’s cute
    <br><br>
    His latest opportunistic adventure was yesterday. We were round at my friend’s house, one he has been too plenty of times and one which has a great big back yard with lots to sniff and keep him occupied. It also has two rickety side gates, which were checked on arrival and declared closed, but which turned out not to be. Sitting at their dinning room table, I noticed a flash of brown outside and my first thought – Chico’s escaped! - was confirmed on quick inspection of the backyard. He was off, so were we. Three adults, all in flip flops ran in three different directions, passing cars alerted us to Chico’s direction of flight. 
    <br><br>
    There’s a field opposite their house and he had taken off across it, with my friend in hot pursuit. He would tell me later that Chico got to the edge of the field, stopped and looked back as if to say – “Come on, catch up!” two of us pursued in cars – her beeping her horn to alert other drivers that there was an errant dog, me following the beeping. The more we followed, the more I realised that we were heading in the direction of a major road – 60km an hour limit and very busy, I feared if he got that far and tried to dash across in Chico like abandon, he was done for. 
    <br><br>
    50 metres from the intersection I managed to pull my car in front of him across the road, hoping it would send him back, away from the main road, but he merely looked at me, panting, darted behind the car and disappeared. By the time I had parked my car and got out, both Chico and my friend had vanished. There was no screeching of brakes or honking of horns from the main road so I figured he’d headed down a side street. I was wrong. 
    <br><br>
    He had crossed the highway, unscathed – I wish I could say the same for my wits. A cyclist was his undoing – leaning down to take a hold of his collar, he fell from his bike. Ever the gentlemen, Chico stopped to see if he was ok and the chase was all over. 
    <br><br>
    It ended the way many of his opportunistic jaunts do, with a passing stranger reeling him in – the opportunity of getting a head scratch temporarily overwhelms the need to run and has been his down-fall many a time. That, or the heat becoming too much, or finding himself cornered when he went in search of a cat. 
    <br><br>
    My friends were relived he had been caught and was unharmed. Everyone who knows us and knows Chico, knows that he is an opportunist and will run off should the opportunity to do so present itself. We are always asked (and in fact the friends who I visited yesterday asked me within minutes of our arrival) when the last time he ran off was, and the response is normally – “not for a while, we haven’t given him a chance to”. 
    <br><br>
    It got me thinking that we need two Chico related items made, (1) a sign that says it has been … days since Chico’s last escape, and (2) a Chico bingo card, with such squares as – ‘Chased Chico down the street’ / ‘Chico licked my face’ / ‘Chico begged me for food’ / ‘Chico stole some of my food’ /’Chico has sat on me’ and so on and so on. I think they would be a hit.
