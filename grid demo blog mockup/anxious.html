                    I’ve tried to keep my posts fairly light hearted so far but since this blog is called 'The Road Anxiously Travelled' I should really give an insight into what that means for me, and so it’s about to get a bit more ‘real’. <br> <br>
                    I don’t know whether it wasn’t really spoken about before, or whether I have just become more aware of it, but I never really knew what anxiety was until about 4 years ago. I feel like it is a hot topic at the moment, you can’t seem to escape the word anxiety or maybe it’s just the podcasts I listen to and the articles I read, but it seems everyone has experienced or is experiencing anxiety in one form or another. <br> <br>
                    Day to day this year, I have felt more anxious than usual, 2020 has been a lot, even in my little, isolated, pretty unaffected by Covid, corner of the world. I feel like the things that cause me anxiety are more heightened and I need better ways of coping than working my way through the beer fridge and the wine cellar (a section of the wardrobe in the spare room, but it sounds fancier to call it ‘the cellar’).  <br> <br>
                    It’s great that there are people out there in the public consciousness, or those who have a voice, speaking about these issues. Of course, no two people are going to experience anxiety in the same way. For me, I get anxious in new social situations, I’m not great at asking for help or directions – think mild panic attack, and I get super nervous and anxious when someone I love is travelling, even if it is just a routine car journey (I’ve seen how Perth drivers are on the roads and the fact that I haven’t been rear-ended on the freeway yet is a source of surprise and worry). <br> <br>
                    Growing up I thought of myself as shy and then later, introverted, both of which I can be. Looking back now, I realise I also had some serious social anxiety (which has not left me), coupled with just generalised anxiety about the world, I’m a worrier – always have been and it’s exhausting. I remember having my first panic attack and not knowing that was what it was. I was 18, I had driven myself to the local indoor ski slope, because I was going on a school ski trip and not having skied in 2 years my dad wanted me to have a practice before I went. It was the middle of a week day, so it wasn’t busy, I remember the car park was pretty empty and the sky was grey and foreboding and I had been feeling nervous the whole drive over and then when it came to getting out of the car, I couldn’t. I couldn’t move, could barely breathe, and I was scared – what the hell was happening. I sat in my car until I could breathe, waited a good amount of time and then drove home and told my parents I’d had a good practice – that skiing was like riding a bike and I’d be fine. I intended to go back another time, I honestly can’t remember if I did.  <br> <br>
                    There have been countless other times when something as innocuous as going for a swim in a public pool has seemed insurmountable; I think it is the thought of interacting with another person at the desk where you pay for a swim – asking for permission is hard, even in situations where you know that the answer is more than likely going to be yes and the other person is not standing there in judgement of your choice to come to their place of work and ask to use their public facilities. It meant that I didn’t join any clubs at university, unless I already knew someone there. It means that a lot of my interactions with staff in shops and facilities start: “I’m sorry, this is probably a really stupid question…”.  <br><br>
                    I get so angry at myself, because I’m an adult, I should be able to do basic things like ask for directions or ask a server in a restaurant for help. My husband knows I struggle with this and he’ll step back sometimes and indicate that I should do the asking in certain situations and sometimes I can and sometimes I make an excuse and then feel angry at myself for the next hour, or 2 hours, or 2 days. I’m not good when I don’t know the rules or if the rules are not obvious in a certain situation, this could be where to stand at a bar, or which counter to pay at in a shop, it can be paralysing. <br> <br>
                    Case in point – my husband (Ben) and I went to a brewery for lunch when we were away a couple of months ago. He bought the first round of drinks and ordered the food; it was fairly quiet and there wasn’t really a queue at the bar. Then, we had finished our drinks, were after another round and it was my turn and that’s when I see there is a big queue, I say I’m going to wait and Ben tells me that I just need to go to the other side of the bar where there is no one waiting and order drinks there. Well, there is no sign that you can order drinks in that area and no one else has approached that side of the bar to do so, I feel paralysed, I’m sure he is not lying to me, but I also feel like I’d be breaking the rules if I don’t queue behind everyone else. I figure I’ll wait until I see someone go to where Ben told me to order drinks, five minutes pass and no one does. I’m getting more anxious – all I need to do is get up and walk over to the bar and order drinks, if I’m in the wrong place, no one is going to shout at me, so what is the problem? I can’t do it, by this point I have worked myself up to the point where Ben has to go and get the drinks and he does exactly what he told me do and gets served, no problem.  <br> <br>
                    There are people in my life who don’t understand this, who tell me ‘just go and do it, it’s fine’. Well, <em>just do it, it’s fine</em> might work for you, but it doesn’t work for me. It’s like I’m rooted to the spot and I know that if I just move one foot in front of the other and go, that it’s not so bad and I’ll most likely achieve the desired result, but the going can be terrifying. I don’t know why, and people who have never experienced anything like this will think it seems insane, which is exactly how it feels sometimes. Imagine having two people in your head, one of them is curled in a ball, slowly rocking to and fro with their fingers in their ears and the other one is standing shouting at them to get up and do something.  <br> <br>
                    I can’t say that I’ve gotten better over the years, some days it’s easy to uncurl myself and listen to the shouting and feel enough to <em>just do something</em>, other days I lose the struggle. I fear it’s going to be a lifelong battle, but I’m not about to stop fighting. <br> <br>
